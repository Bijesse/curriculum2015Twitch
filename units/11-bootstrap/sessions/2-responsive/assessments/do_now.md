Open both of the websites below in different tabs of your browser:  

* [nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com)

Drag the size of your broswer window to be very small. See how the website changes as the page gets smaller.

One of these sites is **responsive** and the other is not.

1. Which site do you think is responsive? Why?
2. Why is it important to make a website responsive?
3. Do you spend most of your time browsing the internet on a mobile device (phone or tablet) or on a computer?
