##Overview

The focus of this project is to create a website about a character from a TV show or movie. Students will complete all of the wireframing and will all of the code for this site. This website must be styled using Bootstrap.
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have ran through the Bootstrap lessons associated with this unit.

### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this project.

### Solution Code

There is no solution code for this project. The sky is the limit!

However, feel free to check out [this example of a completed site](https://rawgit.com/Bijesse/evilCharacter/master/index.html).

### Assessment

1. Student's websites will be assessed based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance
2. Return graded Exit Ticket from previous class.
3. Students are completing the [Do Now](do_now.md).

###Opening

Creating a website from scratch is a long process. It is not as simple as just writing code. There is a lot of planning and thought that has to go into it to make sure the site functions properly.

###Introduction to New Material ("I Do")
Today, you are going to create a website for a fictional character of your choice. Things that the website must include are:

1. This site must have at least 3 pages:  
 --A home page  
 --A store page  
 --A media page for interesting images and videos 
2. Bootstrap grids (Site must be responsive.)
3. Bootstrap buttons 
4. Bootstrap Jumbotron
5. Bootstrap Nav Bar

**It is up to the teacher's discretion if the students shall work alone or in pairs.**

###Guided Practice ("We Do")
####Brainstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. Wire frame each of the pages your site will have on paper.

####Setting up your environment
Create a GitHub repo and clone a Cloud9 workspace for this project.

**Step one:** Create a new GitHub repo called fictional_charater

**Step two:** Create a new workspace in Cloud9 using that repo.


Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE:** Remind students that it is common practice to push you changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub.

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`


###Independent Practice ("You Do")
Students will work alone or in pairs on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference. Consider having support teachers teach mini-lessons to review the various components.

###Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

###How to Submit
Students must push all final code to their GitHub repository. Students will then share the link to their repo at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document.
