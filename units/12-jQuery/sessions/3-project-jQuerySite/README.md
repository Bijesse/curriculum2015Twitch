# The jQuery Site

##Overview

The jQuery site will be created in the process of completing the Independent Practice ("You Do") sections of [Lesson 1](1-selectors/README.md) & [Lesson 2](2-events/README.md) of this unit. The focus of this project is to create a website using almost entirely jQuery code. There will be some basic HTML code for jQuery interaction but that is all.
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have ran through the jQuery lessons associated with this unit.

### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this project.

### Solution Code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/12-jQuery/lessons/3-project1) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Students' websites will be assessed based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xinwHFPJFaeDlvJt-O_xwQe3GAEwhAEbUtVgnmtwWho/edit#gid=0), paying special attention to the Events row.
