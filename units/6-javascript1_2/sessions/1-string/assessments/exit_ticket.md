Write a function, in JavaScript, that takes in two parameters: a string containing the first name of someone and a number representing the temperature today. The function should print out two sentences:

"Hi [FIRST_NAME]!"  
"It is [WEATHER] today"  

If the weather is less than 30 degrees, then print out "freezing"; if the weather is between 30 and 70, print out "chilly"; if the weather is between 70 and 100, print out "warm".
