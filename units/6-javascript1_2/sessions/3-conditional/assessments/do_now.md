#Solve This Riddle


You have a sheep, a wolf, and a head of cabbage. You need to take them across the river to the market, but you only have room in your boat to take one at a time. If left alone, the wolf will eat the sheep, and sheep will eat the cabbage. How do you get all three across without having one of them eat the other?
