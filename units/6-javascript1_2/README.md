#Unit 6 - JavaScript 1.2

##Synopsis
This unit starts with an introduction to strings. After becoming comfortable with strings, students then create their own Mad Libs game. After mastering strings, students learn about conditional statements. Once students learn conditions, they start interacting with the user based on questions that users answer.
