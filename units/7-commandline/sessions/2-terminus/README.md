## Before Class

### Daily Objective

Students will be able to navigate the Terminus Game while building their skills in Terminal commands.

### Key Points

* The commands used in Terminus are the same commands used in the terminal.
* There is an end to the game. It takes a VERY long time to beat, but there is an end.

### Assessment

1. [Do Now](assessments/do_now.md)
2.[Exit Ticket](assessments/exit_ticket.md)
3. Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the Exit Ticket. No project needs to be submitted.

### Vocabulary

* Location
* Directory
* Less
* Touch
* Backtrack
* Gamification

## During Class

### Do Now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance.
2. Return the checked Exit Ticket from previous class.
3. Students are completing the [Do Now](assessments/do_now.md). 

### Opening

Today, we are going to fortify our terminal skills by playing a video game. This video game was made by MIT students who were trying to create an interesting way to teach the command line. These MIT students are using a process called gamification to make learning a fun activity.


### Introduction to New Material ("I Do")
The lead teacher will bring up the [Terminus Game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/) for the whole class to see. Read, or have a student read, the directions on the first screen.

### Guided Practice ("We Do")
Walk through the first 2-3 commands with the whole class so they can get a feel for how this game is played.

### Independent Practice ("You Do")
Students can spend the remainder of class playing through the Terminus game. Teachers can circulate and attempt to help when a student is stuck. Teachers are also encouraged to play through the game themselves.  

Be sure to leave 5 minutes at the end of class for the closing and the exit ticket.
### Exit Ticket

Give the Exit Ticket.

### Closing

Today, you used a process of gamification to help learn new command line skills. Do you think gamification is an effective way to learn? Would you like to see gamification in other classes?

### Homework

Students are encouraged to continue playing this game outside of class. If they complete the game they should take a sceenshot and will inevitably have untold bragging rights.

## After Class

* Review the Do Now & Exit Ticket. Record in class spreadsheet.
* Prepare for next session / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
