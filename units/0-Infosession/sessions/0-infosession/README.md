## During Class

### Do Now (5 minutes)

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Hand each student a ScriptEd Packet as they walk in.
3. Introduce yourself to every student.



### Opening

“Welcome to ScriptEd! I am **_________** and I work at ** _________** as a _______.” Introduce yourself to the students. Tell them a little about your background -- students love to hear about you! ”Let’s everyone please read over the course syllabus.” Allow student volunteers to read the syllabus aloud. Emphasize the following main points:

* Classes will be held twice a week.
* Students will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* The point of the club is to prepare students for internships with technology firms over the summer. Think of this as a long form job interview.
* Students will go on field trips to great cool tech companies.
* Students will participate in ScriptEd wide hackathons for great prizes.  
* Feel free to email (**Program Manager Name**) (**program manager name**@scripted.org) for any questions especially when concerning attendance.

**Ask students to pull out the packet they were handed as they walked in:** 

* Go through the packet to explain what each permission form is for. Explain that without this packet filled out they are not fully enrolled in the program and would be ineligible for trips, activities, and internships. 

### Switching Gears: Why are We Here?

Ask students if they have ever taken a computer science course. Do they think it is an important skill that they wish they could have more exposure to?  

Play video “What Most Schools Don’t Teach” (see references)  

Wrap up video with a short discussion. Reflect on their 
thoughts.

**Key Points**: Computer programming can get you a career in any field, the offices are amazing, and this is a skill that is sought after in the job market.

### What is GitHub (“I Do”)

Explain that, as a developer, you will be working in online spaces in order to write your code. Github is the industry standard for developers to share the work they have created. 

GitHub is a web based hosting platform. GitHub can be used as a publishing tool, a version control system or a way to collaborate on a project with several friends. GitHub allows you to have local and cloud based copies of your projects.

Explain: "By signing up for github, you will have automatic access to other online environments that we will be using throughout the school year without having to create multiple accounts."


### How to Sign Up for GitHub (“We Do”)

Bring up the [How To: Sign Up for GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wnlGwfGGArk0Ubixiwb4YqzgmuYxgxEgGlyJgdv-Us0/edit#slide=id.gc5bb954e0_0_65) slide deck. Ask students to follow along at bit.ly/scriptedgithub. 

### Signing up for GitHub ("You Do")

With the slide deck as a resource have students sign up for GitHub accounts. Ensure that each student provides their username to the program manager. 

### Signing up for JSBin ("You Do")
Explain that JS Bin is a tool for experimenting with web languages. In particular HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We will be using this as a space throughout the school year to test out code that we write.

* Ask students to go to [jsbin.com](jsbin.com) 
* Click on the yellow "Login or Register" button
* Click on the gray "Login or Register via GitHub" button
* You're done!

### Closing/Homework

Assign students to bring back the completed ScriptEd packet by next class.

## After Class

Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.

Assign students to bring back the completed ScriptEd packet by next class.
