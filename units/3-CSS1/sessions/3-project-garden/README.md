* Prepare to provide students with [starter code](http://jsbin.com/ruqujodove/edit).

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

###Vocabulary
* Starter Code

### Assessment

1. Students will have put CSS styling skills to use by editing an HTML file.

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).


###Opening

Introduce the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Explain that as developers you always want to test your skills and create new things. Be sure to showcase some of the various submissions and highlight how this is all based on the same starter code. Today's project will be our version of the CSS Zen Garden.


###Introduction to New Material ("I Do")

Walk students through the process of accessing the starter code and cloning it into their own account.

1. Students must logon to [JSBin](http://jsbin.com) 
2. Students will access the starter code by visiting [http://jsbin.com/ruqujodove](http://jsbin.com/ruqujodove)
3. Students will select File > Clone to save the code into their own account. 
4. Students will then be allowed to edit the file once they have successfully cloned the starter code

***Teacher Note**: If a student accidentally messes with the starter code you can find a backup copy at [starter-code](starter-code)


Review some of the styling tags they have learned in the previous lessons. Emphasize that they must keep the text and images since this project is based on design and ***not*** content.

###Independent Practice ("You Do")
It's build time!  Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activity
Students who complete the project early may attempt to improve their project by manipulating the page layout.

###Closing
Choose select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit Project
* The students must export this project as a Gist: File > Export as Gist
* Students must submit their **Gist URL** at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document.
