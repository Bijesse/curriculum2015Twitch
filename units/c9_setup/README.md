## Before class

### Objective

Students will be able to.. 

1. Create a Cloud9 account via their Github account 
2. Create a workspace in Cloud9 that clones a Github repository.
 
### Key points

* Cloud 9 is an Intergrated Development Environment (IDE)
* GitHub syncs with CLoud 9 to allow for easy collaboration

### Assessment

1. Complete the exit ticket

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the exit-ticket quiz.

### Vocabulary

* IDE
* Cloud
* Collaboration

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance
2. Students are logging into their GitHub account as instructed on slide one of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B1waYai67ysg7eqhc9Mm1O6fG7XO_WIPkCZxOiwyhj4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Opening
**What is Cloud9?** (Slide 2)

Cloud9 is an open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in the cloud. It is a software application that provides computer programmers with a place to create, edit and debug their source code.


### Introduction of new material ("I do")
(Slide 3)
Until now, what IDE have we been using in ScriptEd?..... JS Bin

Today we will begin working in Cloud 9. JS Bin is not a professional coding environment. **JS Bin is good for prototyping but from now on all projects will be completed and submitted in Cloud 9.** We are taking off the training wheels.

### Guided practice ("We do")
**Create Cloud9 account** (Slide 4)

1. Go to [https://c9.io](https://c9.io) and click on the Github icon in the upper left of the screen as seen below: ![image](http://i.imgur.com/95AGSAw.png)

2. Click on the "Authorize application" button at the bottom of the screen.

3. You may see a pop-up telling you about the different plans Cloud9 offers. Ignore this and click on the green "Remind me later" button in the lower right. 

4. The screen you are now looking at is refered to as your "dashboard"
5. We are going to create w new workspace that will only exist in CLoud9 (not in GitHub too).
6. To do this we are going to click the "Create a new workspace" button. Name the new workspaces "my-first-workspace"
7. The instructor should spend some time discussing the interface of Cloud9 

### Independant practice ("You do")
**Create GitHub Repo and Cloud 9 workspace** (Slides 5-6)

Students are going to follow the directions on slide 5 to...

* create their first GitHub repository
* clone a Cloud 9 workspace from the GitHub repository

At this point the students do not know how to push their code from Cloud 9 back to their GItHub repo. This will be covered in [unit 8 lesson 1](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/Mr_Potato_Head).


#### Exit ticket

Give exit ticket. Slide 7 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B1waYai67ysg7eqhc9Mm1O6fG7XO_WIPkCZxOiwyhj4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Closing

Today you learned how to use Cloud9 and integrating it with GitHub. This will be especially important for the rest of the year as all projects must be submitted via a GitHub repo link.

###How to Submit
This project is not required to be submitted.

#### Homework

There is no homework for this lesson.

## After class

* Grade exit-tickets. 
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
