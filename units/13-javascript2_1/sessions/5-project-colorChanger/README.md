##Scope
This project involves creating a simple site that allows the user to click a button to change the background color of the page. The objective of this project is for students to practice their skills with arrays and jQuery. 

##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit and have completed jQuery.

### Starter code

There is no Starter Code for this project.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/13-javascript2_1/lessons/5-project) for code (private).


##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. [Do Now](assessments/do_now.md) activity

###Opening

Sometimes a simple webpage can be difficult to create.

Let's take a look at a simple page we will be creating today. 

At this point the teacher should demonstrate a working model of the [solution code](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/13-javascript2_1/lessons/5-project) (private repo) to the class. **Be sure to hide the URL of the solution code when displaying to class.**

###Lecture

You are going to build a simple Facebook Wall. Your instructions:

There is no Starter Code for this project. Before beginning to write code you must set up your coding environment.

###1) Setting up your environment
Create a GitHub repo and clone a Cloud9 workspace for this project.

**Step one:** Create a new GitHub repo called fictional_charater

**Step two:** Create a new workspace in Cloud9 using that repo.


Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push you changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`


###Build Time
Students will work alone or in pairs on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

###How to Submit
Students must push all final code to their GitHub repository. Students will then share the link to their repo at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document.
