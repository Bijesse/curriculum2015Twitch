#Unit 4 - Programming with Scratch

##Synopsis
In this unit, students will begin work on Scratch 2.0. Scratch is a block-based programming language that allows for visual representation of a computer program without using any syntax. Through three quick activities in Scratch, students will obtain a basice knowledge of creating Algorithms, Variables, and Boolean Logic. 

##Lessons

1. [Algorithms](lessons/1-algorithms)
2. [Variables](lessons/2-variables)
3. [Boolean Logic](lessons/3-ifElse)
4. [Project: Ol' McDonald MadLibs](lessons/4-project)

##Standards

####English Standards

[CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L9-10.1](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/L/9-10/1/)

Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing or speaking.

[CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.9-10.1.A](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/L/9-10/1/a/)

[CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.9-10.1.B](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/L/9-10/1/b/)  

Use various types of phrases (noun, verb, adjectival, adverbial, participial, prepositional, absolute) and clauses (independent, dependent; noun, relative, adverbial) to convey specific meanings and add variety and interest to writing or presentations.

####CSTA Standards

**CT.L2-03** Define an algorithm as a sequence of instructions that can be processed by a computer. 

**CT.L2-04** Evaluate ways that different algorithms may be used to solve the same problem. 

####ScriptEd Standards

**CPP.L2-03: Variables**
