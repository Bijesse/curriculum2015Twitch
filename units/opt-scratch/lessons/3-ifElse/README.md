## Before Class

###Teacher Preparation
* A further understanding of Scratch. Teacher should be familiar with control, sensing and data blocks.
* The teacher should create a two variable MadLibs program with a logic condition before entering the classroom.  **This will be the final project that students do in the next lesson.**


### Daily Objective
 
* Student will be able to implement Boolean logic using an if/else block in a Scratch program. 

### Key Points

* If/Else statements let us set a condition and execute different code based on whether the condition is met.

### Assessment

1. Students will create a program in Scratch that uses If/Else statements.


### Vocabulary

* Boolean
* Logic

## During Class

### Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Students are instructed to write a sentence using if/else.  Explain that this is any sentence that uses the words **if, then & else.** Teacher should provide example given that this will be a stretch for students - Ex: **If** it is raining **then** I will take my umbrella, **else** I will wear flip flops.

### Opening

Ask students to share their if/else statements with the class. The teacher should write some sentences on the board. Try to emphasize **if/then/else** with a different color font.



### Introduction of New Material (“I Do”)

In a demonstration, the teachers will "act out" a simple demonstration of if, else, else. A simple and fun demonstration is as follows:

"**If** no one's hand is raised, teacher 1 will do a robot dance. **If** every student's hand is raised, teacher 2 will dance salsa. **Else**, all the teachers will square dance."

### Guided Practice ("We Do")

Scratch, along with every programming language in the world, uses if/else states to create boolean logic. Scratch has a block we can use to implement this logic. 

The teacher should create the program below on the board:

### Independent Practice ("You Do")

By the end of class, Students should create a program that asks the user if they would like various flavors of ice cream.

**Extension:** Students can create a game in Scratch using if/else. By changing the color of the background in certain areas a game can be made that has Scratchy the cat say something dependant of we he is on the stage. A great example of a game like this made in Scratch is [Maze Game](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10544966/).


### Closing

“Today we covered the basics of using variables and Boolean logic in programming. You are uncovering more about how a program thinks. All programs use this logic. While you are using your electronics this week I want you to think about the if/else statments running the programs we use everyday.”


### Homework
Students can log into Scratch at home and create a game that uses a variable to keep score. This assignment does not technically need to be graded but should be seen as a way for students to explore further into Scratch outside of class.

## After Class
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
