##Overview

This project involves creating a Madlibs program in Scratch that also includes an If/Else statement.

##Before Class

### Prerequisites

Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

### Starter Code
Students can begin with a blank canvas on scratch.mit.edu

###References

* <http://scratch.mit.edu>, use the "Create" tab
* <http://www.madglibs.com/showglib.php?glibid=185>
* [Printer Friendly MadLibs](http://www.madglibs.com/printglib.php?glibid=185)
* Final Project [Solution Code](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24577972/)

### Assessment

This project will be graded as a summative assessment.

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Hand students a printed copy of the [MadLibs activity](http://www.madglibs.com/printglib.php?glibid=185) OR students may complete [online version](http://www.madglibs.com/showglib.php?glibid=185) (links provided in reference section.)

###Opening

“Please complete the MadLibs activity as a refresher to the parts of speech.” Allow 3-4 minutes to complete. Once complete, have some students share their MadLibs game. Then have a class conversation revolving around variables in a game of MadLibs." 


###Introduction to New Material ("I Do")
You are going to build a MadLibs game using Scratch. This madlibs game will combine the skills we have learned in previous lessons. It must begin with boolean logic before beginning the game. 

You are to create a program that includes the following:

```
An if/else statement that asks the user if they would like to play MadLibs.
Asks the user to provide the various parts of speech.
Places the entire statement together in a say block
```

Additional Guidelines:

* Your functions must be named the same and take in the same parameters.
* Do not modify any of the other files. 
* Note that the "log" button is not natural log (base e) but log base 10.
* The random number button should generate a number between 1 and 1000.

###Independent Practice ("You Do")
It's build time! Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activities
Students who complete the project early may attempt to improve their project by changing the costume of Scratchy the Cat based on the animal selected in the MadLibs game.

###Closing
Reflect on this project with a discussion. What was challenging, what was easy, etc.. The teacher should explain some of the benefits and downfalls of Scratch and explain that you will be moving onto JavaScript next class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers will grade this project for completion and correctness.

###How to Submit Project
* The students must export this project as a Gist: File > Export as Gist
* The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project at [bit.ly/ScriptEdProjects](https://bit.ly/ScriptEdProjects).
