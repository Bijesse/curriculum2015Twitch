## Before Class

### Daily Objective

Students will be able to use the `<div>` tag in conjunction with `id` and `class` to identify areas of a webpage.

### Key Points

* The `<div>` tag is a container. It can hold text, images and/or both.
* By using an `id` or a `class` you can identify portions of an HTML page more closely.



### Assessment

1. Complete the Do Now (located in slide 2 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing)). 
2. Write Exit Ticket based off [assessments from current lesson](assessments/exit_ticket.md).

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the Do Now and Exit Ticket.


### Vocabulary

* `<div>`
* `id`
* `class`

## During Class

### Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Place the Do Now on the board. The starter question can be found in slide 2 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing)


### Opening

Discuss the answers of the Do Now with the class (slide 3 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing)). 

Explain to the students that today they will be learning how to identify parts of a webpage. 

"If you look at the source of any webpage you will notice it is made up mostly of `<div>` tags that are identified with `id` and `class` attributes."

### Introduction to New Material (“I Do”)
#####What is an `id`? (slide 4-5)
Giving a tag an `id	` is like giving it a name. If you didn't have a name, it would be very hard to call on you in this classroom.

When using an `id`, you must ensure that you use the proper syntax noted in slides 4 and 5. 

Can anyone think of a time they were making a webpage and could have used an `id` to improve their page? 

#####What is a `class`? (slide 6-8)
A `class` is very similar to `id	`. They are also used to identify a tag.

They are called on in CSS using a `.` and not a `#`

In many cases, they can be used interchangably. However, you should always use a class to group several IDs. (slide 8)

#####What is a `<div>`? (slide 9)
A `<div>` tag is like a blank container. It can hold anything. The `<div>` tag is used more than any other tag. Now that you are creating larger and more complicated sites, you should get use to using `<div>` tags for almost everything.


### Guided Practice (“We Do”)
Follow the directions on slide 10 to set up an environment for the "You Do" portion of this class.

### Independent practice ("You do")

In the workspace that the students just created, they must now make a simple HTML page that uses `<div>` tags, `id` and `class` attributes.

Encourage students to take this task even further by adding images and more styles.

#### Exit Ticket

Give the [Exit Ticket](assessments/exit_ticket.md).

###Closing
Today you learned about how to use the `<div>` tag, with `id` and `class` attributes. Why is this important? How is `id` different than `class`? Why would you choose to use `class` instead of `id`? 


#### Check for Understanding
Leave time at the end of class for students to wrap up and ask teachers any questions they may have.  


####How to Submit
Students must push their code to their GitHub repo using the following commands in the Cloud 9 Terminal:

`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

This project does not yet have to be share with the instructors. It will soon be shared in a future lesson.

###Homework
Students who are not complete with their site by the end of class should complete it at home for homework. 

## After Class

*  Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
