**This project will be build on practice begun during [lesson 2](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/2-HTML1/sessions/2-devTools) of this unit.**


##Scope

The focus of this project is to edit a live webpage by opening the developer tools and making any edits the student would like.  The final work product should be a New York Times article that has been edited using the browser Developer tools.

##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have ran through the lessons associated with this unit.

### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this project.

### Solution Code

Students should save their code by copying it into a JS Bin file.

### Assessment

Student's websites will be assessed based on the first two rows (HTML, Page Content) of the [ScriptEd Foundations Rubic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xinwHFPJFaeDlvJt-O_xwQe3GAEwhAEbUtVgnmtwWho/edit?usp=sharing).
 
##During Class

###Do Now

Ask students to define the following terms on a scrap sheet of paper:

Webpage, HTML, Tags, Browser, Developer Tools


###Opening

Review vocabulary terms.  Remind students about the NYT project that was begun last lesson.  Remind students of the project expectations.  All students choose an article on NY Times and, using the developer tools, they should edit a story to be about themselves.  Ensure students know how to ask for help throughout this project.

###Independent Practice ("You Do")

It's build time!  Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

###How to Submit

Students are not required to submit this project. Instead, ask students to show off their work by taking a screenshot and bringing it up on the front screen.

## After Class
* Take a quick look at each project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacherâ€™s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
