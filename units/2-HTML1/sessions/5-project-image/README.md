![image](http://i.imgur.com/LnFsXHH.png)

**This project will be build on practice begun during [lesson 4](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/2-HTML1/sessions/4-image) of this unit.**


##Scope

The focus of this project is to have the students learn how to add images to a webpage. The final work product should be a site with two images and text.

### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this project.

### Solution Code

Students should save their code by copying it into a JS Bin file.

### Assessment

Student's websites will be assessed based on the first two rows (HTML, Page Content) of the [ScriptEd Foundations Rubic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xinwHFPJFaeDlvJt-O_xwQe3GAEwhAEbUtVgnmtwWho/edit?usp=sharing).
 
##During Class

###Do Now

Ask students to define the following terms on a scrap sheet of paper:

img tag, src, self closing tag

###Opening

Review vocabulary terms. Remind students about the webpage project that was begun last lesson.  Remind students of the project expectations. All students will create a page with the following criteria:

* A title
* A heading
* 2 pictures, both with text under them.

Review with students the process for saving in JSbin using the directions found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uBzV_Ai6KtdSYoNc4izqnihwMvqzSp8sXmX6uF5PNGY/edit?usp=sharing).

###Independent Practice ("You Do")
It's build time! Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

####Extension
If students complete this project early, they are encouraged to add a list to their page. Students should be directed to Google "How to make a list in HTML" to do this.

###Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.


###How to Submit 
This process can take 5+ minutes, given that its still new for students:

Students must submit their **Gist URL** at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document.
