## Before Class
###Teacher Preparation
For this lesson, students may work in a basic text editor (TextEdit or WordPad) or the work can be completed in JS Bin.

* If using a Mac, make sure TextEdit preferences are set to plain text, **NOT rich text.** 


### Objective

* Students will be able to explain the structure of an HTML webpage.
* Students will be able to create a webpage that contains a head and a body.

### Key Points

* A webpage is a text document running in a browser.
* Programs/robots require specific instructions.
* HTML (Hyper Text Mark-Up Language) gives your webpage structure. 
* FILO (First In Last Out) is the structure for tags on any HTML page.

### Assessment

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the Do Now and independent practice activity.


### Vocabulary

* Webpage
* HTML
* Tags
* Browser

## During Class

### Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2.  Place the Do Now on the board. The Do Now can be found in slide 2 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D0GY8XNuDX4X8ulAKQXft8lp8DRfbynBaP6bAyIg2z8/edit?usp=sharing)


### Opening

Discuss the answer to the Do Now with the class (slide 3 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D0GY8XNuDX4X8ulAKQXft8lp8DRfbynBaP6bAyIg2z8/edit?usp=sharing)). 

Students should eventually arrive at the fact that HTML is a language used to create webpages.

### Introduction to New Material (“I Do”)
#####Slides 4-7
All webpages are made up of HTML. Think about it like this... Your speak in english but Webpages speak in HTML.

 HTML pages are made of of tags. Every opening tag has a closing tag. 
 
 FILO (First In Last Out) is a term used to describe how tags can fall inside of other tags. (reference the analogy with parenthesis in math class).

### Guided Practice (“We Do”)
#####Slide 8
The teacher should lead the class in a live coding session in which everyone creates the webpage on slide 8.

Be sure to have the students run the page in the browser before moving on to independent practice.

### Independent Practice ("You Do")
#####Slides 8-9
Pages have a head and a body just like you and me. They cannot over lap!
The head of the page contains all data outside of the browser window.

Students will then create the webpage on slide 9.

### Closing/Homework
#####Slide 10
Students will need to save today's work by copying their code into JS Bin and exporting the file to their GitHub.

**This process can take up to ten minutes**

Encourage students to make their own webpages at home before next class.

## After Class
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
