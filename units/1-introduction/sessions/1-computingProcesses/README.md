## Before Class
###Teacher Preparation
* Must have copies of [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2338t7VZqsoRy1pLWJyZ3gyb2M/view?usp=sharing) printed.
* Two blank pieces of paper ready to be either taped or tacked to the back wall.


### Daily Objective

Students will be able to demonstrate the ability to use computing thought processes to complete simple tasks by writing specific instructions a robot could follow.

### Key Points

* Humans and programs take in directions differently.
* Programs/robots do not assume anything.
* What can you do that a robot can’t?
* What can a robot do that you can’t?

### Assessment

1. Informal assessment of student involvement during activity.
2. Assigned homework: write directions for a making a paper airplane.


### Vocabulary

* Computer
* Computing
* Program
* Algorithm

## During Class

### Do Now (5 minutes)

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Introduce yourself to every student.
3. Students are writing down their answer to the Do Now question:  
**Who is smarter, a human or a computer?**

### Opening

“Welcome to ScriptEd! I am **_________** and I work at ** _________** as a _______.” Re-introduce yourself to the students. Tell them a little about your background -- students love to hear about you! 

Remind students of the course syllabus. Emphasize the following main points:

* Classes will be held twice a week.
* Students will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* The point of the club is to prepare students for internships with technology firms over the summer. Think of this as a long form job interview.
* Students will go on field trips to great cool tech companies.
* Students will participate in ScriptEd-wide hackathons for great prizes.  
* Feel free to email (**Program Manager Name**) (**program manager name**@scripted.org) for any questions, especially when concerning attendance. 

### Icebreaker

Go around the room and have students share their name, grade, and a fun fact about themselves many people may not know. (Give examples like: traveled to a foreign country, plays an instrument, speak multiple languages, beat a game with an impressive score, makes crafts in their spare time, etc.).



### Introduction to New Material (“I Do”)

Re-ask the Do Now question: Who is smarter, a human or a computer?  

At this time a small debate should stir up in the class. Teacher should direct conversation to end with a claim that resembles the idea of “Computers are better at some stuff, but they can’t think for themselves.”


### Guided Practice (“We Do”)

Teacher asks a student (preferably a student in the front row) to get up and take a piece of paper off the back wall and place it on a desk. **The paper should be placed in the back of the room before class.

“Notice how I gave him/her about 2-3 directions to complete this task.” 

“Now let’s try something different. **I am a robot.** Give me directions to do the same with the other piece of paper on the back wall.” Students will now give directions one at a time in order of where they are sitting. The teacher will follow the directions exactly as they are stated.

For example: If the direction is stated as “Turn right”, the teacher should spin in place clockwise until the next student tells them to “Stop.”

### Independent Practice ("You Do")

Students then break up into groups of two, one human and one robot. The human in the group will provide directions to the robot, WITHOUT LOOKING, to draw a smiley face. The robot will then draw as it is instructed to. 

### Closing/Homework

Today for homework you are going to complete a similar process that will be acted out in class tomorrow. Write directions, for a robot, to fold a paper airplane.

## After Class

* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
