<h1>TinyTurtle Tutorial Glossary</h1>

<p>
  Here's some terminology used in the <a href="./">tutorial</a> that you
  might be unfamiliar with.

      APIs are the filament that connects what i want to <em>do</em>
      with what i want to <em>learn</em>.

      Technically, API stands for <em>Application Programming
      Interface</em>. Practically speaking, it's really just a
      collection of (hopefully) well-documented functions and similar
      abstractions that allow you to do what you want to do with a
      programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a programming language is a <em>language</em>, then an API
      is a bit like a specialized <em>dictionary</em>, providing useful
      nouns and verbs that programs can use to do their job.

      See the <a href="https://github.com/toolness/tiny-turtle#api">TinyTurtle
      API</a> for an example.

    <p>
      A function is like a verb, or action, in a programming
      language. It's easy to create your own; see the 
      <a href="http://jsforcats.com/#writing-functions">Making new
      functions</a> section of <em>JavaScript for Cats</em> to
      learn how.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some programming languages, functions are referred to as
      <em>procedures</em> or <em>subroutines</em>. They're all basically
      the same thing.

      JavaScript is an astonishing language, in the very worst sense.

    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language created by Brendan Eich in 1995
      under the time constraints of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#The_first_browser_war">First Browser War</a>
      and some marketing constraints imposed by Netscape's partnership
      with Sun Microsystems. These contributed to it being a very
      <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html">misunderstood</a> programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, JavaScript is not a very easy language to learn,
      and it's a lot less readable than languages that lacked its
      constraints. However, it's also ubiquitous: it runs in web pages,
      which makes it extremely easy to share, and it can also be used to
      program robots, financial trading platforms, web servers, and
      a lot more. In other words, if there's something you want to do,
      there's probably an <a href="#api">API</a> for it in JavaScript,
      which makes it an extremely useful language despite its flaws.
