<p>
  Before embarking on this journey, you may want to check out
  <a href="http://jsforcats.com">JavaScript For Cats</a> or
  <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> to 
  understand the basics of the language. Or you can just start hacking
  and learn things from the <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> as you go.

  <blockquote>
    Programmers care more about making it work <em>eventually</em> rather
    than trying to make it work the very first time. The best way to
    learn is by making mistakes!

    <strong>Fear not.</strong> Nothing you type on this page will damage
    your computer in any way. Programming is all about tinkering, with
    curiosity guiding your path.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Play around.</strong> If you don't understand what a piece
    of code is doing, try changing it. What happens when you remove the
    code? Or when you change a number in it? Or when you copy and paste
    it somewhere else?

    <strong>Ask for help.</strong> If you're stumped, you can always

<h2><a id="square" href="#square">I. Square</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  Turtle geometry is a different style of doing geometry, just as Euclid’s 
  axiomatic style and Descartes’s analytic style are different from one
  another. Euclid’s is a <em>logical</em> style. Descartes’s is an
  <em>algebraic</em> style. Turtle geometry is a <em>computational</em>
  style of geometry.
  <cite data-page="55">Seymour Papert, <em>Mindstorms</em></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The TinyTurtle <a href="glossary.html#api">API</a> makes it easy to
  experiment with Turtle geometry.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>forward</code> function tells the Turtle to move forward by
  some number of pixels.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>right</code> function tells it to turn right by 
  some number of degrees.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>stamp</code> function tells it to draw its current
  <em>state</em>: that is, its position and orientation. This is
  visualized as a small, pointy triangle.
</p>

<p>
  Can you add to the code below to make the Turtle draw a square 
  100 pixels wide and end with the same state that it started?
</p>

<script data-role="lab" type="javascript/lab">
forward(100);
right(90);

stamp();
</script>

<script data-role="solution" type="javascript/lab" data-text="See Atul's solution">
// Here is Atul's solution to the square problem.
forward(100);
right(90);
forward(100);
right(90);
forward(100);
right(90);
forward(100);
right(90);

stamp();
</script>

<aside class="panel">
  <strong>Hint:</strong> If you're having trouble, try to "play Turtle."
  Stand up and move your body as the Turtle on the screen must move in
  order to make the pattern you want.
</aside>

<h2><a id="squares" href="#squares">II. Squares</a></h2>

<p>
  If we encapsulate our square-drawing code into a
  <a href="glossary.html#function">function</a> that takes an
  argument specifying the size of square to draw, we can use it as a building 
  block for more interesting things.
</p>

<p>
  Can you complete the code below?
</p>

<script data-role="lab" type="javascript/lab">
function square(width) {
  // Fill in this function!
}

square(100);
right(20);
square(80);
right(20);
square(60);

stamp();
</script>

<script data-role="solution" type="javascript/lab" data-text="See Atul's solution">
// Here is Atul's solution to the squares problem.
function square(width) {
  for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    forward(width);
    right(90);
  }
}

square(100);
right(20);
square(80);
right(20);
square(60);

stamp();

<h3><a id="refactoring" href="#refactoring">Code Is For People</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
  <cite>Hal Abelson &amp; Gerald Sussman,
    Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  See, all my procedures are mind-size bites.
  <cite data-page="103">Robert, a seventh grader, <em>Mindstorms</em></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Writing functions keeps our code compartmentalized
  into mind-size bites that are easy for humans to understand. Whenever
  you're having trouble understanding your own code&mdash;and
  <em>especially</em> when you notice yourself copying-and-pasting lots of 
  chunks of it&mdash;consider splitting it up into functions to make it
  more concise and easier to grasp. This process is called
  <em>refactoring</em> and it's a useful practice that even professional
  programmers struggle to do regularly.
</p>
</aside>

<h2><a id="triangle" href="#triangle">III. Triangle</a></h2>

<p>One of the principles of Turtle geometry is called the <strong>Total
  Turtle Trip Theorem</strong>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  If a Turtle takes a trip around the boundary of any area and ends up in
  the state in which it started, then the sum of all turns will be
  360 degrees.
  <cite data-page="76">Seymour Papert, Mindstorms</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Can you use this theorem to fix the code below, which is trying to
  draw an equilateral triangle and finish with the Turtle in the same
  state that it started? You just need to replace <code>SOMETHING</code>
  with an actual number.
</p>

<script data-role="lab" type="javascript/lab">
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  forward(100);
  right(SOMETHING);
}

stamp();
</script>

<script data-role="solution" type="javascript/lab" data-text="See Atul's solution">
// Here is Atul's solution to the triangle problem.
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  forward(100);
  // The turtle needs to make 3 identical turns to draw a triangle, and
  // since they all need to add up to 360, that means each turn should be
  // 360 divided by 3, or 120 degrees.
  right(120);
}

stamp();
</script>

<h2><a id="circle" href="#circle">IV. Circle</a></h2>

<p>
  Can you use the Turtle Total Trip Theorem to finish this function that
  draws a circle based on a given circumference, and returns with the
  Turtle in its original state?
</p>

<script data-role="lab" type="javascript/lab">
function circle(circumference) {
  // Draw a circle here.
}

circle(300);
stamp();
</script>

<script data-role="solution" type="javascript/lab" data-text="See Atul's solution">
// Here is Atul's solution to the circle problem.

function circle(circumference) {
  // When we walk in a circle, we move forward a tiny bit and turn right
  // a tiny bit. By the end, we will have traveled circumference distance
  // and rotated 360 degrees.
  for (var i = 0; i < 360; i++) {
    forward(circumference / 360);
    right(1);
  }
}

circle(300);
stamp();
</script>

<aside class="panel">
  <strong>Hint:</strong> It may help conceptually to think
  of the circumference as the total distance the Turtle must travel
  before it returns to its original state. Also, play Turtle!

<h2><a id="going-further" href="#going-further">Going Further</a></h2>

<p>
  Playing with Turtle Graphics in this tutorial is nice, but you might
  be wondering how to put your design into a real webpage. See the
  <a href="https://github.com/toolness/tiny-turtle#readme">TinyTurtle
  documentation</a> for instructions on how to do this.
</p>

<p>
  You might also want to take a look at the TinyTurtle source code,
  <a href="https://github.com/toolness/tiny-turtle/blob/gh-pages/tiny-turtle.js">tiny-turtle.js</a>, to see how it works. It's pretty short, and reading other
  people's code&mdash;especially code you use yourself&mdash;is one of the
  best ways to learn. If you find bugs, you can even
  <a href="https://github.com/toolness/tiny-turtle/issues">file an
  issue</a> and fix it.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, consider reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms</a> by Seymour Papert, which
  explains the pedagogy behind Turtle graphics, among many other
  revolutionary ideas about education.
