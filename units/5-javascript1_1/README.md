#Unit 5 - JavaScript 1.1

##Synopsis
This unit starts with an introduction to variables. Students will learn how to create, instantiate, and edit variables. Next they will learn how to call and create functions. They will also be exposed to functions helpful for debugging. They will learn how to generate a random number. 

##Lessons

1. [Variables](sessions/1-variable)
2. [Functions](sessions/2-function)
3. [Project #1: Tiny Turtle](sessions/3-project-tinyturtle)
4. [Project #2: Calculator](sessions/4-project-calculator)

##Codecademy Resources
The following CodeCademy lessons correspond and will help student understand  the concepts in this unit. The teacher may choose to assign these lessons if they would like.

1. [Javascript - Getting Started with Programming](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-6LzGd/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661) - covers introduction to basic types and variables.

##Standards

####CPP.L2-05 I - Variables
1. Student	can	create,	name,	and	assign	values	to	variables.
