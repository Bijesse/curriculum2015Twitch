##Do Now 
Begin this lesson by completing the [Do Now](doNow.md) activity.

##Scope
You've just been hired as a game developer for Games Forever to create a web game using JavaScript. You've been given total creative control with a few tiny constraints. The game needs to be controlled using the left, up, down, and right keys (or if you prefer the WASD keys)

##Project Criteria
The Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project.

* This game must use jQuery key bindings to move the character
* The user must be able to play the game using the WASD keys and the Up, Left, Down, Right keys
* It must have at least one player
* The character must have the ability to respond to other elements in the game (like an enemy or another player)
* There must be a win condition for players


##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, the employee will be able to create interactive pages and games using key binding events with jQuery and object-oriented JavaScript to manipulate a web page or create a game.

##References/Tools
* [jQuery keypress docs](https://api.jquery.com/keypress/)
* [Key Codes](www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html)

##Vocabulary
* Event Handler
* Key Bindings
* Multiplayer Game

##Instructions
If you have not already seen a final product ask your instructor to show a working game.

You are not given any Starter Code for this project. However, your manager has provided you with some useful direction to complete this project. Follow the step-by-step instructions below. 

Although these directions do not provide all the answers for this project, they do provide you with the guidance you will need to make this project.

###1) Create a GitHub repo and C9 workspace for this project


###2) Create a Game Board
In order to create a gameboard you are going to need to use a tag new to HTML5. You will need to use the **canvas tag**

To learn more information about the canvas tag...... Google it! :P


###3) Create a character
When creating a character you have a few options:

* Google "sprites"
* [Use any of these](http://www.spriters-resource.com/)
* [Create your own Sprite](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/1/). Consider holding off until later to complete this.

###4) Set up the collision feature
This can be accomplished using the coordinates of the two objects.


##Bonus Criteria 
Your Manager has offered a stipend of $500 for each of the bonus requirements listed below:  

* Have the sprite start in a random location on the canvas
* Make this a 2-player game
* [Create your own Sprite](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/1/)
