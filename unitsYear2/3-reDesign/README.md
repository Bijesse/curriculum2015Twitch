##Do Now 
Begin this session by completing the [Do Now](doNow.md) activity.

##Scope
Every website on the internet was designed and wireframed by a team of developers. The website for the company you are at is no exception. Your manager has tasked you to re-brand the company's homepage. They believe the current homepage is dated and it is time for a new look. You have been given 1 week to complete this rebranding project.

##Project Criteria
Your Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project: 

* You will be paired programming with another intern on this project. You may choose who you would like to work with now.
* A proper [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) must be approved by an instructor before code is written.
* The page must be styled with Bootstrap
* The code for this page must be stored on GitHub



##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project the employee will be able to...

* Create and push a GitHub repository
* Wireframe a webpage
 z* Use and implement several bootstrap components in your site

##Instructions

There is no Starter Code for this project. Before beginning to write code you must first wireframe the page you will make. 

###1) Wireframe
1. You may choose to wireframe this site with pen and paper or with a free online wireframing tool.
2. Your wireframe must be approved by an instructor before moving on to step 2.

###2) Create a GitHub Repo
Before you begin writing the code for this project, one member of the group must first create a new repository in GitHub.   
For information on how to create a new GitHub Repository see [this resource](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

###3) Clone your new repo into a Cloud9 account workspace
1. Copy the "clone URL" from your new repository
2. In your Cloud9 dashboard click on the "Create a New Workspace" button and select "Clone from URL"
3. Give this workspace a name that is appropriate and be sure it is set to public
4. Insert the clone URL from this repo and select a custom template

Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push your changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your manager will be grading you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

###4) Share your Cloud9 workspace with your partner
You and your partner can work on the code for this project at the same time using the collaboration feature in CLoud9.

In order to set this up click on the "Share" button in the top right-hand corner of your workspace.

##Grading Criteria
Your manager will be grading your capability on this project based on [this rubric](assessment.md).

##How to Submit
The final code for this project must be pushed back up to your repo on GitHub. **Then share the link to your repo at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document (bit.ly/ScriptEd).**  

To push to GitHub, run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

##Homework
Instructor will assign homework based on progress in class.
