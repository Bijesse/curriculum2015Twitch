##Instructions
###1) What are you going to make?
There options are endless! You could make any number of things anything from an app that helps keep you organized to a game that lines up various types of candy that people play for hours on end.

When thinking of creating a new WebApp think about a problem you or someone in your neighborhood has that can be solved with technology. Will you use an API? Will you make your own API? You can do anything!!

There is only one rule: **Do not spend time thinking about the business model!!** Make the product first. The money comes second.

###2) Wireframe your WebApp
What will it look like?   

Also how will it function? Think of the features you will need to build out.

###3) Create a GitHub repo and shared workspace.

###4) Divide the work
Who is going to work on the different aspects of this WebApp? 

##How to Submit
Push to your GitHub and promote to friends and family! Also be sure to add this to your portfolio page.

The final code for this project must be pushed back up to your repo on GitHub. **Then share the link to your repo at the project submission link found in the header of the Daily Session Document (bit.ly/ScriptEd).**  

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`


##Homework
You are your own boss! Feel free to work on this outside of ScriptEd as often as you would like.
